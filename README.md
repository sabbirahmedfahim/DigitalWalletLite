# DigitalWalletLite â€“ Console-Based Java Wallet

A Java console-based digital wallet system with MySQL backend. All logic is in a single `Main.java` file. This is a `lite version` of our main project, which was postponed due to some uncertain reason. We like to think youâ€™re clever enough to handle any complexity if you decide to run the projectâ€”but donâ€™t worry, itâ€™s not too scary. ðŸ˜‰
