# DigitalWalletLite â€“ Console-Based Java Wallet

DigitalWalletLite is a lightweight Java console application with a MySQL backend.
Itâ€™s designed as a simple, easy-to-understand demonstration of how Java programs can interact with a relational database to manage user accounts and transactions.

It was originally developed as part of my university  **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Database Management System (DBMS)** courses, and represents my first attempt at a coursework project, through which I learned a lot.
